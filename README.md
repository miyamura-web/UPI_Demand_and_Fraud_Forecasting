# Predictive Analyticsin the UPI Ecosystem : Demand Forecasting and Fraud Detection

## Introduction :
This project applies predictive analytics to the Indian UPI (Unified Payments Interface) ecosystem to forecast transaction demand and detect potential fraud. It combines **Simple Linear Regression** for demand forecasting and **Logistic Regression** for fraud classification, providing a dual perspective on digital payment trends and risks.

### Objectives
- Forecast UPI transaction demand using **Simple Linear Regression (SLR)**.
- Detect potential fraudulent transactions using **Logistic Regression**.
- Evaluate model performance using RÂ², RMSE (for regression) and accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score (for classification).
- Generate actionable insights for fintech and policymakers.
