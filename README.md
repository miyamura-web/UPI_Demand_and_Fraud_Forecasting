# Predictive Analyticsin the UPI Ecosystem : Demand Forecasting and Fraud Detection

## Introduction :
 The rapid adoption of the Unified Payments Interface (UPI) has transformed India’s digital payment
 landscape, driving both unprecedented growth in transaction volumes and rising concerns over fraudulent
 activities. This study presents a dual analytical approach to understanding and predicting key aspects of
 the UPI ecosystem—demand forecasting and fraud detection.

 
 In the first part, a Simple Linear Regression (SLR) model is employed to predict UPI demand based
 on historical transaction data and influencing factors such as internet penetration, smartphone usage, and
 digital payment adoption trends. The model effectively captures usage patterns, offering insights into
 future UPI transaction growth.

 
 In the second part, a Logistic Regression model is developed to classify and predict potential fraudulent
 transactions using features such as transaction amount, frequency, location, and time-based behavior.
 The model demonstrates strong accuracy and reliability in identifying risk-prone transactions, providing a
 foundation for proactive fraud prevention.

 
 Together, these models showcase how predictive analytics can enhance decision-making, operational effi
ciency, and security in digital payment systems. The findings contribute to both academic research and
 practical applications for fintech institutions aiming to strengthen India’s digital economy
